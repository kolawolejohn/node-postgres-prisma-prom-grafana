# node-postgres-prisma-prom-grafana

This is a simple node.js project, Where I aim to reinforce the knowledge of node.js with other technologies

#Technologies used are

- Node.js
- Expressjs
- Postgres
- Prisma
- Docker
- Prometheus
- Grafana

The app was dockerised and prometheus + Grafana were used for observabilities

## Check package.json to see the npm packages I used and commant to start the application once cloned

We can make it open source and turn it to a learning playground
